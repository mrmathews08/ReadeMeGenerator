## Description 
When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project. A command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.

Even this very README.md file was created using its own application!

## Usage
This command line application can get rid of the hassle of writing a readme.md from scratch. Through a series of prompts in the command line, the application can generate the readme.md file organized and filled in with the user input information.
